# Developer Information

## Intellij on Windows 10
Using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) set the Terminal to use `bash.exe` to
 enable the use of ADR tooling.
 
When trying to run `packer` locally need to use `packer.exe` as this is 
installed on Windows not the Linux box being used by WSL.

## WSL
Could we build a box, provision a box for what we need? ADR tools have been 
installed manually at this time.
